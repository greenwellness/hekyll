bq. "Hekyll":https://github.com/bmcmurray/hekyll is a presentation generator that uses "Jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll and "Impress.js":https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js to create awesome presentations. You write "Markdown":http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax files, which get turned into individual slides for an Impress.js presentation.

Updates Rob Jentzema voor Green Wellness 2014

For anyone who wanders in here, I'm trying to figure out what I'd like with this tool and separate some concerns, possibly the same way Jekyll Bootstrap, or some other way. For now I switched to "Textile":http://redcloth.org/hobix.com/textile/ for my _table preference_ I guess most of it. I'll try and see if, in time, I can clean some stuff up and submit a commit or two to the upstream project if I'm happy with it (lean/clean/elegant enough).
